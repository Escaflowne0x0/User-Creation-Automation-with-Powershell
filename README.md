# User-Creation-Automation-with-Powershell
This is a Script that I made to automate the creation of users in Active Directory giving you the chance to select several things like Username, Email, OU location. Creates a random secure password, synchronize them with Office 365 / Azure, assign them a license if needed and generation a log file with the whole process including the user's information and result in case of failure.
